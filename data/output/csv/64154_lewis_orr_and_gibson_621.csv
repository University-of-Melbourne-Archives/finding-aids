Thomas Robertson, with his wife, three sons, James, John, and Thomas, and
two daughters Jane (later Skene) and Margaret (later Philip), arrived in
Melbourne early in 1840 from Glenmuick, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The
family settled at Mt. Mitchell in 1846, and worked as a partnership
Robertson & Sons until 1872. Thomas senior died later the same year, and
the three sons divided the property acquired by the family. Thomas
received his share in money, James took Mt. Mitchell, Pleasant Banks,
Heath Springs East, Lockhart, and Moray West properties while John
became the proprietor of Yarram Yarram including the Wannon run, and
Victoria Valley including the Moora Moora and Gazette runs.
It is chiefly with James and his descendants that the bulk of the papers
is concerned. He married Margaret Gordon, and there were four sons and
three daughters of the marriage - Thomas, James Gordon, John Gordon,
Francis Robert Gordon, Annie (who remained unmarried), Christina Gordon
(later Morrison), and Margaret Gordon (later Buchanan).
James Gordon Robertson married Anne Bath Farrer; there was one son,
James Rowland, who later held the Skene property.
Thomas and his wife Grace had at least one son, John Seymour. John
Gordon Robertson died unmarried, and Margaret Gordon Buchanan died
without issue.
Francis had three sons and one daughter - James Ochiltree, Francis
Ochiltree, Gordon Ochiltree and Jean Ochiltree (later Beatson). Francis
lived on Mortat, at Goroke.
Christina Gordon Morrison's children were James Robert, John Gordon and
Margaret Gordon.",5/5,1840,5/5,1872,5/5,1840-01-01,5/5,1872-01-01,5/5,[]
